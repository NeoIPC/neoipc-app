# Releasing

neoipc-app is a single product released with **`vX.Y.Z` git tags** (npm/semver, so a pre-release
suffix like `v0.0.1-alpha` is valid). The version in `package.json` is the source of truth (the
`d2-app-scripts` build reads it; `d2.config.js` sets no `version`).

## How a release works

1. **Bump `package.json`'s `version`** on `main` (via a PR) to the version you intend to release,
   and **describe that version in [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)** under a `## [<version>]`
   heading. A pull-request check fails while the section is missing, because a tag is immutable
   and a section found missing after tagging costs a version number rather than an edit.
2. **Push the release tag** `v<that-version>` (e.g. `v0.0.1-alpha`). That single push triggers the
   release — there is no separate "publish a Release" step.
3. CI (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) then:
   - verifies the tag (minus `v`) equals `package.json`'s version (a mismatch fails the release);
   - runs `yarn build`, producing the installable bundle `build/bundle/NeoIPC-<version>.zip` (the
     archive is named from `d2.config.js`'s `name`, not from `package.json`'s);
   - creates the GitHub Release with that version's `CHANGELOG.md` section as its body — marked
     **pre-release** when the version carries a pre-release suffix — and fails without one;
   - attaches the `.zip` to the Release. A Release that already exists for the tag, whether from an
     earlier run or published by hand, is given the same body and the freshly built bundle.

Manual `workflow_dispatch` builds the bundle without attaching (a build smoke-test).

## Installing a release

The `.zip` asset is a standard DHIS2 app bundle. Install it on a DHIS2 instance via **App Management
→ Upload app**, or with `d2-app-scripts deploy`. Publishing to the **DHIS2 App Hub** is a separate,
credentialed step and is not automated here.

## Consumers

The reporting stack records which neoipc-app release it was validated against: the NeoIPC Surveillance
Reports product (Surveillance-Toolkit `reports/compatibility.yml`) names the `neoipc-app` version it
was tested with, and the NeoIPC-Reporting image derives that value onto itself as a
`net.neoipc.app.tested` label. That reports release's CI blocks it from naming an unreleased
neoipc-app, so a referenced version is always a real released tag.
