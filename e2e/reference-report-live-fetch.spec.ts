/**
 * The Reference Report's admin live-fetch filters, which no other spec reaches:
 * `reference-report.spec.ts` runs as a report-only user, for whom the whole
 * section is absent. Two of those filters are covered here.
 *
 * **Test units.** `testUnitFilter` is an *apply-the-filter* flag — its backend
 * default of `true` is what **excludes** test units — while the checkbox states
 * the outcome ("Include test data"), so checked maps to `false` and unchecked
 * omits the parameter. Nothing about that reads correctly at a glance, and the
 * defect it replaced was exactly this polarity inverted, so it is pinned here at
 * both ends. `src/api/reports.test.ts` already fixes the second half — that the
 * form value `false` reaches the wire as `testUnitFilter=false` — so what these
 * tests add is the half no unit test can reach: that the control a user actually
 * sees produces that value, and that the value drives the exclusion.
 *
 * The first test observes the exclusion **in the DOM rather than in a rendered
 * report**, which is what makes it cheap enough to assert both polarities:
 * `departmentExcludeGroups` is derived from the same `testUnitFilter` value, so
 * admitting test units changes which departments the Departments picker offers.
 * The seed provides the pair this needs — `AT_TEST_TEST2` is in `TEST_UNITS` and
 * `AT_TEST_TEST` is deliberately outside it — so a control that did nothing, and
 * one wired to the opposite value, both fail on a set of offered options rather
 * than on a number buried in a report.
 *
 * The second test binds that to the request, because "the picker changed" and
 * "the backend was told" are different claims and only one of them is what the
 * report depends on.
 *
 * Runs as superadmin: `allowNone` on the dataset select, and the live-fetch
 * section itself, are both admin-only.
 */

/**
 * Put the form into live-fetch mode with the filter section open.
 *
 * Both steps are the ones a user takes. The dataset must be `(none)` or every
 * filter renders disabled — the saved dataset fixes the cohort — and the section
 * is a collapsed disclosure whose body is not in the DOM until its toggle is
 * clicked, so the fields cannot be reached without opening it.

 * against the collapsed control would pass whatever the exclusion did.
 *
 * `alwaysOffered` is the settled-state signal, and it is load-bearing twice
 * over. It cannot be the portal element — `#dhis2-portal-root` is a positioning
 * container with no box of its own, so it reports hidden while the menu inside
